## Project 3: Creating Customer Segments
### By Vedavyas Kamath


### Goal/Aim
This project is to look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained by using two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company.


### Overview
Data used in this project is real-life  data provided to us by our Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. And I as a Data scientist have used unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.


### Python Scripts:
All the analysis has been included within a single iPython notebook to showcase work related to this project. 


### Findings

1. We can see that people who have either of a dreamful, social, cultural or family-orient personality type are more likely to be customers and popular with mail order company.
2. Holding low interest in finance also seems to be a contributing factor.
3. As customers are likely to be people that are culturally and socially oriented, we also see that high community size and high density of households in a neighbourhood are also contributing factors.
4. It can also be seen that people having high online affinity and people who are members of the youth group for environmental sustainability are more likely to be customers.


### Software Requirements
This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
